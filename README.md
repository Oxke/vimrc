# vimrc

My personal neovim configuration file.

After having spent way too much time tweaking my config and not quite liking
every aspects of it, I've decided to use LazyVim, disabling some stuff, adding
some plugins and changing the keymaps to match my old vim config.

I still have to port my Ultisnips to Luasnip but that I'll do when I have time
and it seems like a long thing to do.
