# vimrc

My personal neovim configuration file. It consists of the standard lua setup:
one `init.lua` file and a `lua/` folder for the different modules. Inside that
folder are two subfolders: `config/` and `plugins/`. The `config/` folder
contains the configuration files both for the whole editor and for the plugins,
and the `plugins/` folder contains the plugin setup (using "lazy.nvim").
